## Manila Water AI Foundry - Mizuho Bank Presentation

---

## **OPENING (30 seconds)**
*"Good [morning/afternoon]. Today I'll demonstrate how Manila Water is transforming our operations through AI - not just making things faster, but fundamentally changing how we serve 7 million customers across Metro Manila. What you'll see are four distinct AI capabilities that represent our complete digital transformation strategy."*

---

## **OVERVIEW: Four Strategic AI Use Cases (2 minutes)**

### **Framework Introduction**
*"Our AI strategy is built on four pillars that address every aspect of business operations - from instant employee productivity to autonomous problem-solving. Each represents a different level of AI sophistication and business impact."*

### **Use Case 1: Give me what I'm looking for**
*"This is AI making humans faster. Our employees can instantly access any information - leave balances, procedures, reports - in seconds instead of days. Think of it as having an expert assistant who knows everything about Manila Water policies and data."*

### **Use Case 2: Tell me what I don't know**
*"This is proactive AI. Instead of waiting for problems, our AI continuously monitors for compliance risks, performance gaps, and hidden opportunities. It's like having a business analyst working 24/7 to spot what we might miss."*

### **Use Case 3: How do I... What's the outcome?**
*"This is strategic AI. It doesn't just identify problems - it provides data-driven recommendations with predicted outcomes. When we ask 'How do we improve our ticket closure rate?', AI analyzes patterns and gives us a complete optimization strategy."*

### **Use Case 4: Do you want me to...?**
*"This is autonomous AI. It goes from analysis to action. When AI detects a compliance risk, it doesn't just alert us - it offers to schedule testing, create work orders, notify teams, and generate reports. This is where AI becomes truly transformative."*

## **DETAILED DEMONSTRATIONS**

### **Use Case 1: Employee Self-Service (3 minutes)**

#### **Setup**
*"Let me show you real productivity transformation. Our 15,000 employees used to wait 2-3 days for simple HR queries. Watch this."*

#### **Demo Steps**
1. **Select employee**: *"I'm logging in as Maria Santos, an engineer"*
2. **Ask question**: *"How many days leave do I have left?"*
3. **Show response**: *"In 1.8 seconds, she gets complete leave balance from multiple systems"*

#### **Business Impact**
*"This represents 80% reduction in HR workload and â‚±17M annual savings. But more importantly - employee satisfaction improved by 1.2 points because they're not waiting for basic information."*

#### **Key Talking Points**
- *"Sources are real - employee database, HR policies, payroll systems"*
- *"Security is built-in - employees only see their own data"*
- *"Works 24/7 - no more waiting for business hours"*

### **Use Case 2: Business Intelligence (4 minutes)**

#### **Setup**
*"Now let's see AI as a business analyst. This AI continuously monitors our operations and proactively identifies what we need to know."*

#### **Demo Steps**
1. **Select question**: *"Am I compliant to DOH water quality regulations?"*
2. **Show analysis**: *"Watch how AI doesn't just answer - it provides insights we didn't ask for"*
3. **Highlight proactive findings**: *"It identified coastal pipe aging as an accelerating risk"*

#### **Business Impact**
*"This AI prevented â‚±45M in penalties last year by detecting compliance risks 2-3 days before they became critical. Traditional analysis takes 3-5 days. AI does it in 3 seconds."*

#### **Key Talking Points**
- *"Real-time data from 16 service areas across Metro Manila"*
- *"Predictive analytics - 72 hours until potential non-compliance"*
- *"Financial impact quantified - â‚±850M investment vs â‚±2.1B penalty risk"*

### **Use Case 3: Strategic Guidance (4 minutes)**

#### **Setup**
*"This is where AI becomes a strategic consultant. Instead of just reporting problems, it designs solutions with predicted outcomes."*

#### **Demo Steps**
1. **Ask strategic question**: *"How do I improve ticket closure rate?"*
2. **Review analysis**: *"AI analyzes all our tickets and identifies three optimization opportunities"*
3. **Show predictions**: *"It predicts specific outcomes - 87% to 95% closure rate improvement"*

#### **Business Impact**
*"This level of analysis would take our team 2-3 weeks. AI provides it instantly with 94% accuracy in predictions. We've achieved â‚±68M in strategic value using these recommendations."*

#### **Key Talking Points**
- *"Industry benchmark comparison - we're at 87%, target is 92%"*
- *"Prioritized by impact - billing auto-resolution gives highest return"*
- *"ROI calculated - â‚±12M annually from efficiency gains"*

### **Use Case 4: Agentic AI (5 minutes)**

#### **Setup**
*"This is the most advanced capability - AI that doesn't just analyze, but acts. Most AI stops at recommendations. Ours offers to execute the solution."*

#### **Demo Steps**
1. **Trigger detection**: *"Let me simulate AI detecting a water quality issue"*
2. **Show AI proposals**: *"Watch how AI doesn't just alert - it offers specific actions"*
3. **Execute workflow**: *"In 6.2 seconds, AI completes what would take us 6-8 hours"*

#### **Business Impact**
*"This represents 99.97% speed improvement and 97.5% accuracy improvement over manual processes. But the real value is in prevention - catching issues before they affect customers."*

#### **Key Talking Points**
- *"Full audit trail - every action is logged and traceable"*
- *"Human oversight maintained - AI proposes, humans approve"*
- *"Multiple systems integrated - lab scheduling, work orders, notifications"*
